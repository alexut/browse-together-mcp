# Test Plan for `config.ts`

## Objective
To ensure the configuration system behaves correctly by testing its outputs and interactions.

## Test Areas

1. **Environment Variable Loading**
   - Verify that environment variables are loaded with the correct defaults.
   - Test validation errors when environment variables do not meet schema requirements.

2. **CLI Argument Parsing and Transformation**
   - Ensure CLI arguments are parsed correctly in both long (`--app-env`) and short (`-e`) forms.
   - Verify that the mapping from CLI arguments to environment variables works correctly.
   - Test that transformed CLI arguments match the expected structure.

3. **Configuration Precedence**
   - Test that the precedence order (CLI > Env > Defaults) is maintained.
   - Check that defaults are applied when neither CLI nor environment variables are provided.
   - Verify that partial CLI configurations correctly override only the specified values.

4. **Error Handling**
   - Confirm that meaningful error messages are provided for invalid configurations.
   - Test the system's response to missing required configurations.
   - Ensure type validation works correctly for transformed CLI values.

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests** (file: `config.test.ts`)
  - Test `parseCliArguments` with different CLI argument formats and combinations
  - Test `mergeConfiguration` to ensure proper precedence
  - Verify `configMapping` correctly maps CLI keys to environment keys
  - Test the overall behavior of `getConfig` to ensure it integrates with dependency injected environment and dependency injected CLI inputs correctly
  - Test `getBrowserLaunchOptions` to ensure it extracts the right values

- **Mocking**: 
  - Use mocks for environment variables and CLI arguments to simulate different scenarios
  - Create test fixtures with different combinations of inputs

## Tools
- Use Deno's built-in testing framework and mocking capabilities.
- Utilize assertions to verify expected outputs and behaviors.

This plan focuses on testing the configuration system's behavior and outputs, ensuring robustness and reliability in various scenarios.
